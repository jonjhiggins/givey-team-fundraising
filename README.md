# Givey Team Fundraising

## What's Givey?
[Givey](https://www.givey.com/) is a charity platform on which 100% of your donation gets to your Charity.

## What's [Givey Team Fundraising](http://jonjhiggins.github.io/givey-team-fundraising/) (this project)?

* Demonstrates how the Givey API can be used to track the progress of a business or team raising money through Givey for a specific cause.

* Serves to encourage others to donate to the cause as the team seek to reach their target.

* Is based on the [We are 10](http://weare10.neteffekt.com) project I worked on for [neteffekt](http://neteffekt.com) - but completely rewritten in Angular and to be more generic for the benefit of others.

## Usage

At the moment, to adapt it for your own uses you would need to download and edit as you see fit. It currently supports basic customisation via URL parameters:

* Change the `giveyBusiness` that's loaded: `http://jonjhiggins.github.io/givey-team-fundraising/#/?giveyBusiness=GIVEYBIZ`
* Change the `teamName`: `http://jonjhiggins.github.io/givey-team-fundraising/#/?teamName=A%20different%20team`
